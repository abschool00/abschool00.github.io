            <h4>This composite takes the classic and well recognized piece of Grant Wood entitled American Gothic and uses the symbolism of a pocket watch and a potted plant in order to represent the imaginary forces of mother nature and father time. American Gothic is often used and modified to represent and showcase many different things. From political statements to artistic interpretations this piece is used to represent many different things to the viewer, in the case of this piece it is meant to give a physical and somewhat satirical embodyment to the forces which many people relate. This image lives purely online on this discussion feed in order to be changed and modified as time and nature often are.</h4>

            <h4>This piece was a call back to early media art where alot of the time the interface was hard to navigate and the piece itself seemed absurd and hard to look at. This work was a web based maze meant to confuse and disorientate the viewer with bright colors, confusing text and an omniscient voice playing with while helping the viewer navegate the piece.</h4>

            <h4>I created this piece with the theme of artificial nature in mind. That meant recording things that were associated with nature but were not in fact natural. Once I found those sound clips I put them to the cadence of a watch ticking to show the passage of time. I placed the files in Audacity and faded the sounds in and out always going back to the ticking of the watch. I then exported the file into premiere to overlay the sound file with a picture of a calm river. </h4>

            <h4>This piece was created by first creating a digital painting and then printing it out. After i did that I proceeded to burn out the location of the sun on the image with a lighter. I then ran the piece through a copyer multiple times to darken the image physically. After this I scanned the image and cropped it to the original size. This gave the effect of giving the scene an artificial darkness that is distorted and eerie.</h4>

            <h4>This piece was a logo designed for my friends youtube channel. The piece consists of his own designed character being the duck on the label. I then took an image of an empty jar and editing it to look shattered and then creating jam that was exploding out of the jar hence JammyBam. The floating jam also loosely spells his channel name.</h4>
