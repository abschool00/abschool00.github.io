    <p>For this project I had originally planned on making a game where you have a navigation app that does not lead you to where you want to go. Now, with our current pandemic I thought it might be interesting to do a Choose Your Own Adventure style game with the theme being ongoing events. The premise for the game is that you are a survivor during the Covid-19 pandemic and must go about your day to day tasks and survive these new conditions. The style of the game is based off of classic choose your own adventure style books and games. I wanted to approach this in a comedic but morbid fashion and make the player feel uncomfortable at times that they found certain aspects funny. This is meant to mirror the complex emotions that we all feel during these unique times. </p>
    <p>I began my research by studying what resources have been affected by the current pandemic and why they are in short supply. I also researched how people are spending their time during the crisis and what kind of day to day problems people are having, such as food and toiletries shortages. I used this information to help me narrow down my story and decide what challenges the main character will face throughout. After I had figured out how I wanted to arrange the story, I then exaggerated How bad the current situation is and made every single choice into a possible life or death situation. This adds to the difficulty of the game as well as giving some entertaining deaths for the player to enjoy. </p>
