            <h4>This piece was created with an attention to hands and objects and how they interract. The theme is an icy frozen nothingness with dark blues and blacks in the background with a dismembered frozen hand holding onto an ice tray. The piece is meant to call to attention the fact that the cold can be a harsh unforgiving environment.</h4>

            <h2>2015</h2>
            <h4>An eclectic collection of objects found at my house that was arranged in a visually appealing way. It was then photographed and drawn as realistically as possible. The idea is to illustrate the kind of things we keep in our pockets such as coins, keys, small toys, and other things that are completely useless but still find their way inside and arrange them in a way that they seem to go together and draw your eye diagonally across the page.</h4>

            <h4>A venture into large scale realism, this piece shows the calm and mysterious nature of one of the worlds strangest land animals. The Okapi stands as a largely unknown creature with unique features such as stripes on the hind legs like a zebra. This piece focuses on high contrast shading and fur texture on a larger scale paper.</h4>

            <h2>2015</h2>
            <h4>This drawing marks a sort of rebirth for my artworks. Before this point I avoided color like the plague but I realized that I could not do black and white drawings my whole life, I needed to expand my horizons. This piece began with a phoenix in my usual style of graphite pencils before adding colored pencil and charcoal sticks, 2 mediums that I was very unfamiliar with. This stark contrast between the vibrant colors and the muted black and white of the bird represents my transformation towards harder and more interesting art pieces.</h4>

            <h2>2014</h2>
            <h4>Thies piece was an experiment to see how I could get texture like scales as well as shading. It was also an attempt to create the look of moisture and reflection in the eye. This is a work in progress shot of the snake but I think that it better highlights the technical aspects of the piece.</h4>
